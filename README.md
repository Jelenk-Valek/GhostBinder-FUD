**Description**
---- 

GhostBinder-FUD is an advanced payload binding tool designed to merge multiple payloads with legitimate applications, maintaining high levels of stealth and undetectability.

It also has the capability to inject executables into images, videos, PDFs, text files, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and more.

**Features**
----
*  **Payload Binding**: Seamlessly bind multiple payloads into a single executable.
*  **Polymorphic Stubs**: Generate unique stubs for each binding to evade signature-based detection.
*  **Code Obfuscation**: Employ advanced obfuscation techniques to hinder reverse engineering.
*  **Dynamic Encryption**: Encrypt payloads in memory at runtime to avoid static analysis.
*  **Anti-Debugging**: Detect and thwart debugging and virtual environments.
*  **Anti-Sandbox**: Identify and prevent execution in sandbox environments.
*  **Custom Execution**: Configure delays and triggers for payload activation.
*  **Flexible Binding**: supports injecting in various file types, including JPG, PNG, PDF, DOC, and XML.

**Usage/Install**
